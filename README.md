# JavaLibraryPractice
This repository is the home of my Java library proyect, in which i make available a grafic interface for libraries where they can be borrow books.
# Classes of the proyect
- Book: The Book class contains all the attributes, and the methods that will manage them, of the book type objects that will be from which users would request a loan.

- User: As the Book class, the User class contains all the attributes of the user type objects, in which will be all the data of the new users of the library when registered.

- Library: Library is a class in which i use encapsulation, i created two vectors, one of books and another of users, as attributes of the class, then i used methods to manipulate the two of those, so that i can let users for example be able to unsubscribe or borrow books from the library.

-Interface: The interface class is the one where the menu is declared, it use control sentences to move between the different points of the menu and thus offer users the different services of the interface.
